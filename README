DESCRIPTION
-----------
This is a module designed to allow NCSA-style imagemap entries
to reside in forms, triggered by a fill-out form TYPE=IMAGE field.

It has both client-side and server-side capability, though at the
present no function is provided to read an external mapfile. You
could easily do it yourself with:

	@map = `cat mapfile`;

After installation, you should be able to access the documentation
with the command:

	perldoc CGI::Imagemap

INSTALLATION
------------
To install this module type

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install


EXAMPLES
---------
A couple of meager examples are in the directory example/.  To install,
copy the testmap or testmap.old file to a script-aliased cgi-bin
directory, copy the file testbar.gif to your document root (if desired,
it will even work with the [BROKEN IMAGE]), and trigger the test by
typing the URL into your browser.  You shouldn't have much trouble with
this if you are wanting to use this module. 8-)

BUGS
-----
The untainting is set globally and reset when using class methods --
this may break threaded applications.  I don't deem that too likely
with CGIs, but you never know.

CGI::Form and the other CGI modules redefine carp(), croak() and 
confess(). This may cause warnings.  If so, you could comment out
the 'use Carp;' in the module.  If anyone knows a better fix,
let me know.
